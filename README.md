# TASK6
# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification Task

## 📌 Objective
To implement and understand the KNN classification algorithm using the Iris dataset. The goal is to:
- Normalize features
- Apply KNN classifier
- Experiment with different K values
- Evaluate accuracy and confusion matrix
- Visualize decision boundaries

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## 🚀 Steps Followed
1. Loaded the Iris dataset
2. Normalized the features using StandardScaler
3. Split dataset into training and testing
4. Applied KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn
5. Evaluated performance with accuracy and confusion matrix
6. Visualized decision boundaries using 2D feature space

## 📊 Results
- Best accuracy achieved at *K = 3 or 5*
- Visual decision boundary plotted using petal length and petal width

## 🖼️ Sample Output
(Include a screenshot of your plot or confusion matrix if available)

## 📁 How to Run
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
python knn_classifier.py
